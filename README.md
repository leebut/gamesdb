# Games Database React App

This is a project in progress, so it is not yet complete.
I am learning React from Jonas Schmedtmann om Udemy.
Since I am learning, there may be parts of the code that may not be properly implemented.

## Database API

I am using the API from [https://www.giantbomb.com](https://www.giantbomb.com)
You can optain a free api key from [https://www.giantbomb.com/api](https://www.giantbomb.com/api)

## Functionality

At the moment the search input is not working, so a hard-coded search is in place.
CORS is being dealt with by a third-party [https://corsproxy.io/](https://corsproxy.io/). I will use a Netlify function when I deploy there.
